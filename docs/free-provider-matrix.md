# Free Frontier LLM Provider Matrix

- **Date:** 2026-09-15 (live research day)
- **Method:** live web search (web-search skill) + direct HTTP probes of live API endpoints (`integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/models`, `opencode.ai/zen/v1/*`, `openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`, `api.kilo.ai` docs endpoints) + official vendor docs fetches. Third-party rate-limit claims are marked with their as-of date and source.
- **Project context:** PraisonAI Web is **local-first, BYOK, localStorage-only, zero telemetry**. Every key below is pasted by the user into their browser and sent only to the provider they chose, only when they chat. Nothing is proxied or logged anywhere else.
- **Legend for "In registry?"** — refers to `src/lib/providers.ts` (`FREE_PROVIDERS` — 12 providers at r14, **15 as of 2026-10-05**: + `vyce` r18, `orcarouter` r23, `aihubmix` r30 — see the accuracy-pass addendum at the bottom). Registry ids are given where known.
- **Confidence marks:** ✅ verified live or from official docs on 2026-09-15 · 🕐 as-of (dated secondary source, not re-verified live) · ⚠️ UNVERIFIED (do not trust without checking).

## 1. Comparison matrix

**Integration effort rubric**

| Effort | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **S** | OpenAI-compatible `POST /chat/completions` + static Bearer key — drops straight into the existing `llm-config.ts` registry path (baseUrl + keyPrefix + models list). |
| **M** | Works with the existing code path but needs one extra: an extra param/endpoint quirk, an accountId in the URL, an OAuth-ish login, or a non-default endpoint per model family. |
| **L** | Needs a server-side proxy, a special SDK, or a fully non-OpenAI protocol (Responses API / Anthropic Messages / gRPC). |

| # | Provider | Auth method | Free tier mechanics | Rate limits | Frontier models available | SDK / API style | Effort | In registry? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **NVIDIA NIM** (build.nvidia.com) | Static API key, `nvapi-` prefix, Bearer | 1,000 free API credits at signup (≈1 credit per call, not per token) — no card | 🕐 ~40 RPM per account (as-of Jul–Aug 2026, NVIDIA forum credit-increase requests) | **Live ✅ (82 models today):** Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B-A55B, Nemotron 3 Super 120B, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning 30B, Kimi K2.6 / K3, DeepSeek V4 Flash, GPT-OSS 20B, Mistral Large 2, Llama 3.2 90B Vision.

API and Playground access stop on the Free Trial tier until you purchase credits." Third-party "1M tokens/day free, no card" claims are **outdated** | Trial tier limits moot until credits purchased; paid tiers use dual-bucket token limits ✅ | GPT-OSS 120B (~3,000 tok/s), Qwen 3.8 27B, Llama 4 | OpenAI-compatible `/v1` | **S** | ✅ yes — `cerebras` (honestly flagged `cardRequired`) |

Use Azure AI Foundry instead | — | — | was OpenAI-compatible `/catalog/github/models` | — | ❌ **not in registry — correctly so; DEAD, do not add** |
| 10 | **HuggingFace Inference Providers** | HF token (`hf_`), Bearer | Tiny monthly credits with a free account (~$0.10/mo 🕐), ~$2/mo credits on PRO ($9/mo subscription).

## 2. Big-three deep dive

### 2.1 NVIDIA NIM — `integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`

**Signup URL:** https://build.nvidia.com

**Get a key (3–5 steps):**
1. Open build.nvidia.com and create / verify a NVIDIA developer-program account (free, email verification + occasionally phone OTP — forum reports of OTP delivery issues exist).
2. Pick any model card on the site (e.g. Nemotron, Kimi, DeepSeek) and click **"Get API Key"** (or go to your account's API-keys settings page).
3. Generate the key — it starts with `nvapi-`. Copy it once.
4. Point any OpenAI client at `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` with `Authorization: Bearer nvapi-…`.
5. (Optional) Browse the live catalog yourself: `GET https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/models` is public — we pulled 82 models live on 2026-09-15.

**Rate limits & free tier mechanics:**
- 🕐 **~40 requests/minute + 1,000 free API credits** per account (as-of Jul 6 2026 and Aug 7 2026 NVIDIA developer-forum threads where users request increases to 200 RPM / 5,000 credits — the "current limit" quoted in their posts matches). High confidence, matches r14 registry notes.
- Credits are consumed **per call**, not per token — long-context agent loops burn them fast. When credits run out the account is capped until NVIDIA grants more (or you qualify for higher tiers).

**Top 5 models for coding/research agents (all live in the 2026-09-15 catalog ✅):**
1. `moonshotai/kimi-k3` — strongest open coding/agentic model on the host
2. `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` — NVIDIA flagship reasoner (550B MoE)
3. `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` — sweet spot of quality vs. credits
4. `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` — fast, cheap-class reasoning
5. `openai/gpt-oss-20b` — small, tool-calling-friendly workhorse

**Quirks / gotchas:**
- ⚠️ **Model EOLs are aggressive** — `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` returned `410 Gone … end of life on 2026-08-26` in our live probe; `deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1` and `qwen/qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct` (in our registry) are **no longer in the live catalog**. Validate against `/v1/models` instead of hardcoding.
- Auth is checked **after** model-name validation (a dead model returns 410 even with no key; a live model with no key returns 403 `Authorization failed`).
- Free-tier data handling: NVIDIA trial endpoints log sessions for security/improvement (mirrored in Kilo/Zen docs) — no confidential data.
- Sandbox note (from r14): reachable from the sandbox; no geo-block observed on the models endpoint.

### 2.2 OpenCode Zen — `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/...`

**Signup URL:** https://opencode.ai/zen (docs: https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/) — console login at opencode.ai (the `/console` path 307-redirects to the auth flow).

**Get a key (3–5 steps):**
1. Open opencode.ai/zen and click **Login / Get started**; sign in (email/SSO) — this is a browser flow, no card strictly required to create the account.
2. In the Zen console, add billing details **only if you want paid models** (credits, pay-as-you-go, optional auto-reload of $20 when balance < $5, optional monthly cap).
3. Copy your **API key** from the console (or run `opencode auth login` → OpenCode Zen inside the CLI for the OAuth flow).
4. Use the endpoints below. Model metadata is public: `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`.

**Endpoints (per model family — this is the big quirk):**
| Family | Endpoint | SDK style |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek V4, MiniMax M3, GLM 5.x, Kimi K2.x/K3, **the six free models** | `POST https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible |
| GPT 5.x / GPT 6 Astra / Grok 4.x | `POST https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/responses` | OpenAI **Responses** API |
| Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, Qwen3.7 Max/Plus | `POST https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages |
| Gemini 3.x | `POST https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models/{model}` | Google style |

**Rate limits & free tier mechanics:**
- Pricing is per-request/1M-token, sold at cost (+ card fees passed through). **Six models are priced $0**: `big-pickle`, `mimo-v2.5-free`, `ling-3.0-flash-fin-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-free`, `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` ✅ (official pricing table).
- **CRITICAL (live-verified ✅):** the free tier is **gated to OpenCode clients**. Our probe of `/zen/v1/chat/completions` (model `big-pickle`, no session) returned:
  `{"error":{"type":"MissingSessionID","message":"Error from provider (Console): OpenCode's free tier can only be used in OpenCode"}}`
  → A plain OpenAI-compatible client (our app) **cannot use Zen's free models**; it can only use Zen with a funded account on the paid models.
- Rate limits for paid use: unpublished ⚠️ UNVERIFIED. Monthly workspace/member spend limits are configurable.

**Top 5 recommended models (for coding agents, paid /chat/completions subset):**
1. `kimi-k2.7-code` — $0.95/$4.00, coding-specialized
2. `deepseek-v4-flash` — $0.14/$0.28, best price/perf
3. `glm-5.3-flash` — $0.15/$0.50, fast + cheap
4. `minimax-m3` — $0.30/$1.20, agentic MoE
5. `glm-5.3` / `kimi-k3` — heavyweight open reasoning

**Quirks / gotchas:**
- Free models are a **data-for-usage trade**: Big Pickle / MiMo / Ling / Nemotron free may train on your prompts; Muse Spark Contributor Free explicitly trades training rights for the $0 price; NVIDIA free endpoints are trial-only and logged. Our zero-telemetry stance is unaffected (keys stay local) but users should know.
- Deprecations move fast (a whole GPT-5.x-Codex + GLM-4.x generation was retired mid-2026) — pin model ids loosely.
- For our app: only worth adding the `/chat/completions` subset (S effort); full multi-protocol support would be L.

### 2.3 Kilo Gateway — `https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway`

**Signup URL:** https://kilo.ai (console: https://app.kilo.ai) — Kilo Code was **acquired by Anaconda** (banner on official docs).

**Get a key (3–5 steps):**
1. Sign up at kilo.ai (Google/GitHub/email SSO — same account as the Kilo Code extension).
2. Go to **app.kilo.ai → Your Profile** (personal account, not an organization).
3. Scroll to the **bottom of the profile page** and copy your **API key**.
4. Call `POST https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/chat/completions` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` and `model: "provider/model-name"`.
5. Browse the catalog with the public (no-auth) endpoint: `GET https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/models`.

**Rate limits & free tier mechanics:**
- The free tier is **free models, not free credits**: several models cost $0 for authenticated users, and `kilo-auto/free` is a virtual model that routes to whatever free models are currently available. ✅ Official docs.
- **Anonymous access (no key at all): 200 requests/hour per IP** ✅ official (models-and-providers page) — genuinely zero-signup usage, like Pollinations.
- Frontier models (Claude Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1 Pro, Grok 4, Kimi K2.5, DeepSeek v3.2) **require paid credits** — the task's assumption "free credits for new users" is **outdated**: no signup bonus as of Aug 25 2026 🕐 (an old "$20 first top-up bonus" existed as of May 2026; current pricing page says $0/mo with free-model routing only).
- Authenticated free-model RPM: unpublished ⚠️ UNVERIFIED. New accounts may hit a temporary identity-verification "hold" to prevent misuse (official docs mention it without numbers).

**Top 5 models for coding/research agents:**
1. `kilo-auto/free` — zero-config free router (no key management at all, hops between whatever is free)
2. `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` — strong coding model (paid)
3. `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` — strong coding/reasoning (paid)
4. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` — best-in-class agentic coding (paid)
5. `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` — fast free-ish coding option when rotated into the free set ⚠️ (rotation changes)

**Quirks / gotchas:**
- Model ids are **OpenRouter-style `provider/model`** — our registry's model picker just needs different id strings.
- `kilo-auto/*` virtual models are handy but server-side mappings change silently.
- Data caveat: Auto-Free may route to NVIDIA free endpoints (logged, trial terms) — official warning.
- Public models endpoint (no auth) is perfect for a live-catalog integration like our OpenRouter one.

---

## 3. Recommended additions (ranked)

1. **Kilo Gateway** — effort **S**. OpenAI-compatible single endpoint, OpenRouter-style model ids, **free models + an anonymous no-key tier (200 req/h/IP)**, public model catalog for live refresh, and a paid path to Claude/GPT/Gemini in one vault entry. Best free-tier/effort ratio of anything new we found.
2. **HuggingFace Inference Providers** — effort **S**. One HF token routes to ~18 providers (Groq, Cerebras, DeepInfra, Novita, Together, Scaleway, Z.ai, …) through `router.huggingface.co/v1` (OpenAI-compatible). Free credits are tiny (~$0.10/mo) so it's a fallback/router play, not a volume play — but it multiplies every other provider for free.
3. **OpenCode Zen** — effort **S** for the `/chat/completions` subset, **positioned honestly as a cheap (not free) option**: the six $0 models are session-gated to OpenCode clients (verified live), so from our browser app only paid credits work. Value = at-cost pricing on Kimi K2.7 Code / DeepSeek V4 Flash / GLM 5.3 Flash with zero markup. Add only with a "not free" badge.
4. *(registry fix, not a new provider)* **Refresh `nvidia-nim` model list** — effort **S**. ✅ **DONE r17**: curated list now holds Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B / Super 120B, Kimi K3, DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731, GPT-OSS 20B, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning 30B — probed live from `/v1/models`; the dead Llama 3.3 70B / DeepSeek R1 / Qwen2.5 Coder ids are gone. Keyed providers additionally have the per-card "Refresh models" live-catalog button, which supersedes any curated list.
5. *(excluded, with reasons)* **GitHub Models** (retired 2026-07-30 ✅ — dead), **Chutes** (free perk retirement ⚠️ unverified), **Scaleway** (free tier ⚠️ unverified), **Meta Llama API** (preview retired 2026-07-06 🕐).

## 4. Contradictions vs. what the project currently assumes

| Project assumption (registry/worklog) | Reality (2026-09-15) |
|---|---|
| `nvidia-nim` models: Llama 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1, Qwen2.5 Coder 32B | **Dead/EOL** — Llama 3.3 70B returns 410 Gone (EOL 2026-08-26); R1 + Qwen2.5 Coder absent from the live 82-model catalog. → **RESOLVED r17** — registry refreshed with live ids (see §3.4). |
| OpenCode Zen hypothesis: "free coding models (grok-code-fast, qwen3-coder), maybe OpenAI-compatible" | Free models exist but are **locked to OpenCode clients** (MissingSessionID gate, live-verified). grok-code-fast/qwen3-coder are gone from the catalog (deprecated Feb–Mar 2026); current free set = Big Pickle, MiMo-V2.5, Ling 3.0 Flash Fin, Nemotron 3 Ultra/Lightning, Muse Spark Contributor. |
| KiloCode "free credits for new users?" | **No credits** — the free tier is free models (+ anonymous 200 req/h/IP); no signup bonus as of Aug 2026 🕐. Also note the Anaconda acquisition. |
| Task brief: "GitHub Models — free with GitHub account" | **Retired 2026-07-30** ✅ (github.blog, docs.github.com) — must not be added. |
| Cerebras "free tier with card" | Correct per official docs ✅ — and third-party blogs claiming "1M tokens/day, no card" are outdated. Keep the honest `cardRequired` flag. |
| Together `-Free` endpoints | Could not be re-verified live from the sandbox (JS-walled docs) — keep the existing entry but treat its limits line as 🕐 as-of Sept 2026. |

## r30 addition — AIHubMix (aihubmix.com) — ✅ verified live 2026-09-22 (keyless probes; docs/research/aihubmix-r30.md)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Auth | Static key `sk-…` (console.aihubmix.com) · Bearer · per-key model allowlist/spend-cap/expiry |
| Base URL | `https://aihubmix.com/v1` (alias `api.aihubmix.com`, backup `https://api.inferera.com/v1` — byte-identical probes) |
| API style | Vanilla OpenAI wire + SSE; `max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` both accepted; `top_k`, `verbosity`, `reasoning_effort` (none…xhigh) extras; Anthropic native lane at `/v1/messages` |
| Free tier | **45 live $0 chat lanes** (`pricing 0/0`, active) — no card; fresh accounts get 10 trial calls pre-top-up |
| Free limits | Per account: 5 req/min · 100 req/day · 1M tok/day — LIVE config at keyless `GET /call/free_quota_config` (minute_limit 10 with per-model weight_map 1–10; docs say read the endpoint, don't memorize) |
| Frontier | claude-opus-5 $5/$25 · claude-sonnet-5 $2/$10 · gpt-5.6-luna $0.20/$1.20 · gemini-3.6-flash $1.50/$7.50 · grok-4.5 $2/$6 · qwen3.8-max $1.69/$5.07 · deepseek-v4-flash $0.142/$0.284 (budget) · glm-5.3-flash $0.11/$0.39 · kimi-k3 $3/$15 — all 1M ctx class |
| Router | `model:"auto"` (auto:balanced/quality_first/latency_critical) on chat+images; resolution observable via `x-aihubmix-router-resolved-model` headers; billed at resolved model; no surcharge; session stickiness via `X-Aihubmix-Session-Id` |
| Quirks | Free ids are silently SKIPPED in key-level fallback lists (free may only be primary); retired id → 404 `model_retired`, removed → 410; RFC 9745 Deprecation + Sunset headers; catalog rotates ~20 models/month; `APP-Code` header = 10% off non-Claude |
| Tracker | Keyless Tier-A: `GET /api/v1/models` (852 rows, numeric pricing, `types:"llm"` string, `retire_stage`, ETag) + `/call/free_quota_config` + `/api/router/leaderboard` |
| In registry | ✅ `aihubmix` (r30) — providers.ts + KEYED_ENDPOINTS (keyOptional:true) + ARENA_CATALOG (12 hops) + PRESEED key (coding-glm-5.3-free) + tracker source |

## Accuracy pass — 2026-10-05 (cross-check vs. `src/lib/providers.ts`, round r253)

Every "In registry?" claim and flag above was re-verified against the current registry (15 providers: `vyce`, `aihubmix`, `orcarouter`, `groq`, `google-ai-studio`, `openrouter`, `mistral`, `zai`, `nvidia-nim`, `sambanova`, `cohere`, `together`, `cloudflare`, `pollinations`, `cerebras`):

- **§3.4 / §4 NVIDIA rows — RESOLVED r17.** The stale `nvidia-nim` curated list was refreshed from the live catalog in r17 (Phase 3); the dead Llama 3.3 70B / DeepSeek R1 / Qwen2.5 Coder ids are gone. Keyed providers also have the per-card "Refresh models" live-catalog button, which supersedes curated lists.
- **Registry providers missing from the matrix above:** `cohere` (trial-key free tier; part of the original r14 vault), `orcarouter` (r23 — keyless difficulty-routed free pool, `orcarouter/free`), `aihubmix` (r30 — see the addendum section directly above this note). All are first-class vault entries today.
- **Still holds (re-verified by code grep, not assumption):** `kilo` / `zen` / `opencode` / `huggingface` do NOT appear in providers.ts — §1's ❌ claims remain accurate; `cerebras` keeps the honest `cardRequired: true` flag; `cloudflare` still splices `{ACCOUNT_ID}` via `providerBaseUrl()`; `pollinations` remains the keyless entry.
- Rows 1–19 otherwise match registry ids/flags as of this pass. Rate-limit claims remain 🕐/⚠️ as dated — **no live re-probe was performed on 2026-10-05** (docs-only accuracy pass; no network claims were changed).
