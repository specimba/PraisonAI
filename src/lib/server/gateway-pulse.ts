// ─── Gateway pulse (r161): server-side 429 observability ────────────────────
// The whole park-and-resume epic (r156–r158) made the CLIENT honest about
// rate limits, but the server — the one vantage point that sees EVERY
// completion dial through /api/chat (chat turns, workflow steps, headless
// autopilot) — noticed each 429 at agent-engine.ts and immediately forgot
// it. Cross-round questions like "is the shared gateway congesting again?"
// were unanswerable from the sandbox: runs and park state live in the
// browser's zustand store, and the client-side gateway-cadence module dies
// with the tab.
//
// This module is that missing vantage point: a capped in-memory ring of
// observed upstream 429s, write-through persisted to db/gateway-pulse.json
// so the signal survives dev-server restarts and stays readable via curl
// from outside the browser.
//
// HONEST SCOPE (do not oversell):
// - Counts ONLY completion dials made by the server (agent-engine). The
//   chat completion gateway is the shared free-tier bucket that kills
//   pipeline runs — that is the signal that matters.
// - Browser-direct BYOK dials never touch the server (by design — they are
//   the user's own keys and their own quota buckets).
// - Radar/HF/GitHub/tracker upstream 429s are different providers with
//   different buckets — deliberately NOT folded in here.
// - A restart truncates nothing (file is the source of truth on load), but
//   events older than 48h are pruned so the file cannot grow unbounded.
