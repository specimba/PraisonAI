// ─── Relay health → badge application (r75 consolidation) ────────────────────
// ONE shared implementation of "apply the rotator's verdict to a picker/row
// object". This closure lived copy-pasted in the chat composer and the agent
// form (both splitting "providerId::modelId" by hand); the provider gallery
// had no badges at all. Doctrine (ClawLabs/free-ai-models): catalog presence
// means nothing if the last dials died — every model row shows the rotator's
// LIVE verdict next to its name.
//
// Lives in its own module (NOT lib/relay.ts) so editing it never invalidates
// the rotator core's import graph mid-run — a deliberate HMR-safety choice.
