// ladder's cooldowns (20s + 45s ≈ 65s of waiting) are far shorter than the

// lands inside the same 429 window and the step — then the whole run — dies.
// Schedule-level backoff (r156) only helps scheduled runs; a manual run just
// burns into the wall. Doctrine shift: a rate-limit-dead STEP no longer kills
// the RUN while park budget remains — the run finalizes honestly ("error",
// recovery card, r157 history chip, breaker) and then AUTO-RESUMES after a
// long, escalating wait (5m → 10m → 20m) that outlives the quota window.
// Completed steps are preserved by the normal resume path. Budget is a
// dedicated parkCount (NOT resumeCount — stalls and manual resumes share that
// one; a flaky-gateway deep run could plausibly need both). Parks are live
// only while the app tab is open (worker timers die with the tab) — the
// headless lane keeps its own independent backoff, so nothing is lost.
// r171: budget extended 3→4 parks, cap 20m→30m — 5+10+20+30 = 65m of parked
// waiting, which for the first time outlives a FULL hourly congestion wave
// (pulse-verified: the global free gateway saturates in on-the-hour bursts).
// Each delay is ±20% jittered so concurrent parked runs don't re-dial in
// lockstep with the very cron wave they're hiding from.
// r178: park curves + budgets for BOTH kinds moved to src/lib/park-policy.ts

 *  - busy/gateway-quiet collisions RE-ARM (+60s, bounded) instead of silently

 *    into the lane during the wait is LIKELY, and a silent drop would strand
 *    the parked run forever;
 *  - only an "error" row is resumed — a row the user stopped (or already
 *    resumed) is theirs now;
 *  - originSource is passed through: a manual run's parks stay manual, so a
 *    manual fire into a saturated gateway can never trip the r156 schedule
 *    breaker (2-strike auto-pause) on the schedule lane's behalf;
 *  - on a done settle, an overdue schedule is re-armed from now (+jitter) —
 *    without this, the scheduler's r77 deferral fires a fresh duplicate
 *    full-pipeline run minutes after the parked one completes.
 * HMR caveat: dev reloads drop pending worker timers (same class as the stall
 * timer) — a dev-only park loss, accepted.
