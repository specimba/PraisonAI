// The scheduler deliberately SKIPS a due fire while the same workflow has an
// active run (no double-fire; the first tick after the run ends fires — r76
// made that state visible LIVE via the amber "blocked by run" chip). This is
// the historical half: an append-only, capped localStorage trail of deferral
// EPISODES so the question "why didn't it fire at 16:10?" stays answerable
// AFTER the fact, not just while it is happening.
//
// Lives in its own module (NOT workflow-scheduler.tsx) for react-refresh
// safety: a component file that also exports a non-component function loses
// state preservation on edit (full reload) — which would destroy an
// in-flight client-side run. A new lib file invalidates nothing.
