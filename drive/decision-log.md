# NEXUS WebGUI Harness — Platform Capability Expansion Decision Log

**Round:** r26 · **Date:** 2026-09-20 · **Scope:** Q3-2026 AI landscape → implemented platform enhancements
**Inputs:** GitHub asset audit (r26-2a, 960 starred + 181 owned repos), HF Hub trending scan + arXiv/alphaXiv sweep (r26-2b), codebase integration map (r26-2c).

---

## 1. Evaluated → ADOPTED (implemented this round)

| # | Candidate | Source | What landed | Why it won | Effort |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **arXiv search tool** (`arxiv_search`) | User directive (arXiv + alphaXiv reach); HF dataset `secemp9/arxiv-complete` analysis | New server tool: public arXiv Atom API, 15s deadline, abort-aware, every result carries `alphaxiv.org/abs/<id>` discussion mirror. Registered end-to-end (types, defs, executor, route allowlist, TOOL_META). | No key, no tracking, directly fixes the "briefings are shallow about AI" complaint; gives agents primary-source reach. | S |
| 2 | **Closed-world tool-call validation** | arXiv 2609.19425 (`Closed-World Resolution Against Tool Hallucination`) | `validateToolCall()` in tools-defs.ts wired into BOTH engines + both salvage paths: hallucinated tool names / undeclared argument keys / missing required args are rejected pre-dispatch; the error is fed back as the tool result for same-run self-correction. | ~1h of pure TS kills a whole failure class; highest reliability-per-effort of the 2026-09 paper harvest. | S |
| 3 | **Tool-output provenance fencing + injection scrubbing** | arXiv 2609.14987 (`ActGuard: pre-execution auditing vs indirect prompt injection`) | Every tool message the MODEL sees is wrapped in `<untrusted-tool-output>` fences + highest-signal injection patterns stripped (fake system/assistant separators, "ignore previous instructions", key-exfiltration asks); `composeSystem` now carries explicit injection-refusal rules. UI keeps raw content. | In a BYOK platform the keys live in the browser — tool-content→exfiltration is THE real threat model. Local-first security lynchpin. | S–M |
| 4 | **Security hardening pack** | r26-2c audit; starred security cluster (garak fork, PentestGPT, PurpleLlama) | (a) `node:vm` sandbox is now a **bare realm** — host-intrinsics seeding removed, so `Math.constructor.constructor("return process")()` RCE escape is **dead** (verified live); (b) same-origin gate on `/api/tools/execute` (cross-origin POST → 403, verified); (c) `guardPublicUrl()` SSRF guard on client-supplied relay baseUrls + read_url (metadata IP blocked, verified); (d) GitHub radar proxy sanitizes usernames. | User's standing security emphasis; all four verified by live tests, not just code review. | M |
| 5 | **Pipeline depth control (quick/standard/deep)** | User complaint ("shallow briefing") + dzhng/deep-research pattern + `deepagents` blueprint | `Workflow.depth`: deep = 2 extra deep-research passes cloned after step 1 (tool-union with web_search + arxiv_search) + auto "Verification & synthesis" pass (suppressed when an authored review gate exists); standard = verification only; quick = as authored. Editor segmented control, card/panel chips, export/import round-trip. **E2E verified: Morning Briefing ran 5/5 steps to done, output now carries verified-source annotations and dead-URL flagging.** | Direct fix for the reported product gap; reuses existing review-gate plumbing. | M |
| 6 | **Trend Radar view** | User directive ("check my stars and forked repositories… HF hub… papers reach") | New top-level view (⌘5, `#/radar`): GitHub Stars browser (3×100 pages via `/api/radar/github` proxy — server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` opt-in for 5000 req/h, token never shipped to client; cluster chips + search; localStorage cache with fetchedAt), HF Trending (models/datasets/spaces by trendingScore, client-direct CORS fetch), Paper Radar (validated `/api/radar/papers` proxy over arXiv Atom with arXiv/alphaXiv/PDF link chips). Explicit fetch-only, cached locally — local-ephemeral-but-recoverable semantics. | Turns the round's research methodology into a permanent product feature. | M |

## 2. Evaluated → QUEUED (next rounds, ranked)

1. **Run replay fixtures from callLog** (arXiv 2609.20625 Chronicle) — export a failed run's deterministic prefix, stub tool results, replay. Turns user bug reports into reproducible tests. Effort M.
2. **Versioned Reflexion lessons store** (arXiv 2609.19128 + 2609.05329 memory-portability) — localStorage lessons with model/schema version stamps injected into self-heal retries. Maps to the user's own NEXUS_SAGE/consequenceflow governance concepts. Effort M.
3. **Budget-aware tool-result digest** (arXiv 2609.04915 + 2609.08279) — rolling digest atoms + re-fetch pointers instead of raw truncation in long runs. Effort M.
4. **Skills registry (SKILL.md format)** — anthropics/skills + VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills ecosystem as loadable system-prompt modules; zero backend. Effort S–M.
5. **mem0-style cross-session memory** — post-run fact extraction into an inspectable localStorage store, injected as context prefix. Effort M.
6. **Trace timeline view** (langfuse pattern) — per-step tokens/latency/error-kind from the already-persisted callLog. Effort S–M.
7. **MCP Streamable-HTTP client** (fastmcp) — server-side `/api/mcp` proxy mapping remote tools into the registry. Effort M–L.

## 3. Evaluated → REJECTED (with reasons)

| Candidate | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| RL-training / SFT-corpus papers (UltraData-2609, Dual-Axis PO) | Need GPU training racks; we are BYOK + browser-first. |
| Networked/multi-user agent memory (2609.19502, 2609.12320) | Violates local-first, single-user, zero-telemetry doctrine. |
| GPU Spaces integrations (LTX-2.5 video, MiniMax-H3, wan2.2) | Server-GPU bound; Image Studio's BYOK-API path already covers media. |
| GGUF "uncensored" hype forks (zero-download trend-riders) | Hype without substance — filtered per directive. |
| Remotion in-app video rendering | Heavy bundle for marginal value now; revisit on demand. |
| isolated-vm for run_code | Native dep + build complexity; the bare-realm fix already removes the escape path (verified). Residual: vm remains sync-CPU-bounded only — acceptable for a local tool. |

## 4. Security posture (this round's changes)

- **Fixed:** node:vm host-realm escape (RCE) — bare realm, console capture realm-local; verified `process is not defined`.
- **Fixed:** unauthenticated cross-origin tool execution — same-origin gate; verified 403.
- **Fixed:** SSRF on relay baseUrls + read_url — scheme/host/IP-literal guard; verified metadata-IP block.
- **Hardened:** indirect prompt injection — provenance fences + scrubbing + system-prompt refusal rules.
- **Residual (documented):** DNS rebinding of public names in read_url (redirect hops not re-resolved); node:vm is not a hardened multi-tenant boundary (sync-only CPU budget); GitHub radar proxy trusts the server env token. All accepted for a local-first single-user platform; revisit if multi-user ever lands.
- **Telemetry:** unchanged — zero. Radar fetches are explicit user actions; caches stay in localStorage.

## 5. Verification evidence (r26)

- `bunx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors under `src/`; `bun run lint`: clean.
- Live tool tests (server): arxiv_search returns real papers + alphaXiv links; run_code escape → `ReferenceError: process is not defined`; normal compute intact; cross-origin 403; read_url SSRF block.
- Browser E2E (agent-browser): Radar view — 3 tabs render, GitHub grid = 300 real starred repos via proxy, HF links real, Paper Radar 36 arXiv/alphaXiv links; Workflows — depth control persists (`Morning Briefing → deep`), deep run completed 5/5 steps with detailed, source-annotated output; mobile 390px: no horizontal overflow; 0 console errors.
- Both engines share the new validation/fencing (browser-direct + server auto-engine).

# r27 · Jev / System-One tier · Route Receipts · roster truth-pass (2026-09-20)

**Inputs:** elvis/@omarsar0 Jev thread (user-supplied), Jev deep-dive (r27-2a: docs.typesafe.ai llms-full.txt 895KB, HN 49717558, HF hub reproductions, OpenRouter/Cloudflare listings), model-roster truth pass (r27-2b: Google/Z.ai/Cohere/Together docs + live OrcaRouter 197-model roster + HF), user complaint ("gemini-3.5-pro doesn't exist — where is glm-5.3-flash?"), paper arXiv:2605.01710 (Route Receipts, user-supplied PDF).

## 1. ADOPTED (implemented this round)

| # | Candidate | Source | What landed | Why it won |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **System-One decision tier** (`src/lib/systemone.ts`) | Jev (TypeSafe AI) — `POST /v1/systemone`, choice/score/noul, $0.042/Mtok input-only, 250K tok/s; elvis doctrine "not everything requires a frontier model" | `decide()` ladder: ① Jev native (5s deadline, optional `typesafeKey` in Settings → Model Relay card) → ② fast-model JSON judge over the vault with new relay `taskFit: "decision"` (flash lanes first, flagships demoted −2) → ③ `null` = keep current behavior. First consumer: **System-One gate** before the pipeline verification pass — confident PASS (≥0.75) skips the flagship verify call; worst case = status quo. | Jev is NOT a relay hop (different wire API) — the ladder keeps the Genius-rotator model-agnostic while adding the cheap-judging primitive. Works TODAY with zero new keys via ②. |
| 2 | **Route Receipts v0.1** (arXiv:2605.01710) | User: "this paper also very useful for us" | Engine emits `{type:"receipt"}` on every answered run (both transports + built-in path): requested vs resolved model, `model_identifier_type` fixed/router, fallback {status, coarse reason, from→to}, completion status, structural `redactions: []`. Client merges tool counts (§6 tool ledger) and persists on the message; UI chip = consumer tier (amber "fallback used" only when it happened; hover-quiet "route" otherwise) → popover = developer tier with the full record. Zero telemetry: stored in localStorage only. | Turns relay rotations from invisible magic into auditable runtime facts — exactly the paper's "consumer tier + developer tier" design. "No fallback" is information too. |
| 3 | **Roster truth pass** (relay + registry) | r27-2b evidence: Google docs (no gemini-3.5-pro / no 3.8-flash-lite; Pro line = 3.1-pro-preview), docs.z.ai pricing (glm-5.3-flash exists, cheap-NOT-free; glm-5.3 flagship), OrcaRouter live roster (z-ai/glm-5.3-flash-free verified), Cohere docs (command-a-03-2025), Together serverless list (Turbo-Free retired → Ternary-Bonsai-27B) | DELETED: `gemini-3.5-pro`, `gemini-3.8-flash-lite`, `command-a-02-2025`, `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free`. ADDED: `glm-5.3` (T1 .97) + `glm-5.3-flash` (T2 .92) on Z.ai, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash-free` (T2 .91) on OrcaRouter, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` + `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` on Google, Cohere 03-2025, Together Bonsai+Turbo. "Ordering fixed by removing fiction": fake T1 .965 entries no longer outrank real models. Live-roster-verified hops now carry a **"live ✓"** note. vyce `keyOptional` staleness fixed (keyless /v1/models now 401s). | User-reported + independently evidence-verified. The relay's Elo ordering is only meaningful if the models exist. |
| 4 | **Per-chat model pin** | User: "why still cannot select models from providers we choosed? at chat etc. that is big fault" | `Conversation.modelOverride` ("providerId::model" / "auto::builtin" / unset = global) + `setModelOverride` in the conversations store + searchable ModelPicker in the composer hint row listing ONLY keyed providers (registry rosters + live-catalog extras badged "live") + "Follow global default". `resolveExplicitLlm()` resolves the pin with graceful fallback (keyless → global + warning toast). | The missing BYOK surface: model choice must live where the conversation lives. Never dead-ends by design. |

## 2. QUEUED (from this round's research)

- Jev-powered **tool-result relevance noul** (LiteLLM compaction pattern) for the budget-digest queue item.
- Typed **noul verdicts for review gates** (structured pass/rework with confidence instead of prose parsing).
- Radar triage labeling at scale (System-One batch labeling of starred repos).
- REJECTED (documented): Jev as primary router (vendor lock-in — Genius-rotator doctrine stays model-agnostic), dynamic UIs, RSI/data-synthesis, ambient autonomy (breaks explicit-action privacy doctrine).

## 3. Verification evidence (r27)

- `bunx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors in app `src/`; `bun run lint`: clean.
- Browser E2E (agent-browser): composer picker renders groups (Auto / keyed providers), pin → toast "This chat now runs on DeepSeek V4.1", trigger label updates; chat round-trip answered "R27-RECEIPT-OK" with ROUTE chip; receipt popover = Requested `deepseek-v4.1` / Answered by primary / Fallback `none` / Tools `no tools used` / Completion `complete` / Redactions `none`; Settings → Model Relay shows the System-One (Jev) key card; mobile 390px `scrollWidth == innerWidth` (no overflow); 0 console errors.
- Security posture unchanged this round (receipts and pins are localStorage-only; Jev key is opt-in, stored locally, sent only to api.typesafe.ai on an explicit decision call).

# r26.2 · Base integrity: tools restored + tools expansion ×8 + receipt v0.2 (2026-09-20)

**Inputs:** user evidence "our tools already have problems in base still" (all tool calls 403 "Cross-origin tool execution is not allowed"), r26-2a Jev/tools research (docs/research/jev-system-one.md), r26-2b codebase map (docs/research/codebase-map-r26.md), routereceipt.org canonical v0.1 schema.

## 1. FIXED (base bugs — verified in browser)

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix | Evidence |
|---|-----|-----------|-----|----------|
| 1 | **Every tool call 403** (user's screenshot: URL Reader + Web Search "Tool error: Cross-origin tool execution", 0ms) | r26 same-origin guard compared browser `Origin` to server `Host` — behind the preview gateway/iframe the Host is rewritten, so legit calls failed | `csrfOk()` rebuilt: custom-header preflight gate (`x-praison-csrf: 1`, unforgeable cross-origin without preflight we never grant) + `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` rejection; non-browser clients (no Origin/Sec-Fetch headers) still allowed; client sends the header (`httpToolExecutor`) | curl matrix: legit 200 w/ real results, cross-site 403, CLI 200; agent-browser chat round-trip → "Web Search Succeeded 1.2s" + correct answer |
| 2 | **read_url redirect SSRF hole** | `redirect: "follow"` hopped inside fetch; `guardPublicUrl` only ran pre-flight → public URL could 302 to 169.254.169.254 etc. | manual redirect loop (≤3 hops), fresh `guardPublicUrl` per hop, relative-Location resolution, body cancel on redirect | code review + guard re-runs per hop (P1 from r26-2b closed) |
| 3 | **Jev rung dead code** | `askJev()` sent `prompt`/`options`/parsed `a.p`; API wants `instructions`/`criteria`/returns `a.noul` | wire shape fixed per docs.typesafe.ai (r26-2a live verification); noul answers map 0–1 → yes/no + confidence | tsc clean; ladder falls through gracefully when key absent (unchanged behavior) |
| 4 | **Receipts lied on stopped/errored turns** | `completion_status: "complete"` hardcoded in chat-view success path; catch path attached no receipt | `finalizeReceipt()` helper stamps "complete"/"stopped"/"error" per actual outcome; stopped/errored turns now carry their partial receipt + tool ledger | code paths inspected; types.ts enum already allowed the values |
| 5 | **Custom-endpoint models missing from chat picker** | picker looped `FREE_PROVIDERS` only | "Custom endpoint" group (host-labeled) = `settings.defaultModel` + CUSTOM_MODELS presets; `resolveExplicitLlm` now resolves `custom::<model>` pins | composer.tsx + llm-config.ts; tsc clean |

## 2. ADOPTED — tools expansion ×8 (all live-verified via /api/tools/execute + CSRF gate)

| Tool | Source API | Verification |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `wikipedia_search` | en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php list=search + extracts | ✅ real MCP article + URL |
| `hacker_news_search` | hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search | ✅ real stories (2346-pt post) |
| `github_repo_read` | api.github.com repos+readme (+GITHUB_TOKEN opt-in) | ✅ microsoft/TypeScript stats |
| `package_info` | registry.npmjs.org + api.npmjs.org downloads + PyPI fallback | ✅ zod@4.6.5 MIT |
| `market_rates` | coingecko simple/price + open.er-api.com | ✅ BTC $81157/€70691 (indicative) |
| `uuid_hash` | node:crypto (uuid/sha256/hmac/random) | ✅ real UUIDv4, 1ms |
| `image_generate` | z-ai SDK images (server) | ✅ 1024x1024 generated; status-line-only (localStorage pressure doctrine) |
| `tts_speak` | z-ai SDK TTS (server) | ✅ 2.9s audio via tongtong; status-line-only, read-aloud button pointed to |

Rejected/deferred (from r26-2a scan, recorded with reasons): `code_search` (grep.app 429s keyless), `wayback_lookup` (archive.org blocked from sandbox — revisit), `wolfram_alpha` (needs key), generic `http_request` (SSRF class — run_code/read_url cover), diff/yaml-json transformers (run_code covers), posting/browser/vector tools (unsafe/heavy for a local-first harness).

## 3. ADOPTED — Route Receipt v0.2 (routereceipt.org canonical schema conformance)

- Added canonical required fields: `receipt_id` (UUIDv4), `request_id`, `served_at` + `safety{status,visible_action}` fed by the turn safety audit (injection strips + closed-world rejections), `context.input_truncated`, `tools_allowed`. All optional in TS → old persisted receipts stay parseable; `schema` stays "route-receipt.v0.1" (additive fields).
- `TurnSafetyAudit` threads through both engines' tool loops (agent-engine.ts + api/chat/route.ts); UI chip: consumer tier = amber dot only when safety intervened; developer tier = receipt id (first 8), safety badge w/ visible_action tooltip, ctx✂ flag.
- Deferred per schema: service_tier/effort/region_class fields (no meaningful mapping yet), `moving_alias`/`moderation_refusal` enums (no occurrences today).

## 4. Verification evidence (r26.2)

- `bunx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors in src/ (examples//skills/ pre-exist); `bun run lint`: clean.
- curl: all 8 tools ok:true with real content; CSRF matrix correct (legit 200 / cross-site 403 / CLI 200).
- agent-browser: chat round-trip with web_search → "Web Search Succeeded 1.2s", correct grounded answer, no cross-origin errors.

# r28 — Referral Advantage Registry · qwen3.8-flash · Free/New Model Tracker (2026-09-21)

Context: user provided the Vyce referral link (https://vyceai.com/signup?ref=VYCE_8ZYQDC), reported a brand-new
model on Vyce (Qwen 3.8 Flash, Alibaba Cloud, 1M ctx, $0.1/$0.4) and asked for a "free model tracker ticker"
— a 4-8h watcher that flags brand-new/free models so users catch capacity in its first 1-2 days. Deep-search
research: docs/research/referral-registry-r28.md (r28-3a) + docs/research/free-model-tracker-r28.md (r28-3b).

## 1. ADOPTED — Referral registry with "harmless anchor redirection"

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Vyce referral (VERIFIED official, from vyceai.com's own bundle) | param `ref` on `/signup` + root; referee **$50** signup credit, referrer $10; code `VYCE_8ZYQDC` | first-party evidence ("You get $50 and your referrer gets $10!"), format `VYCE_XXXXXXXX` confirmed in router code |
| Integration surface | chat markdown renderer ONLY (+ provider-gallery signupUrl constant) | chat is where links are consumed/shared; tool args, API calls and same-origin links are never touched |
| Honesty rules | `rel="sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer"` + visible `ref` chip + full disclosure in `title` | research best-practice; transparency over cloaking; Vyce ToS bans automated registration → decoration only, never signup automation |
| Idempotence & scope guards | skip when param already present; path allowlist (`/`, `/signup`); http(s) only; verbatim `ownerLink` entries for dashboard-bound programs | "harmless": existing user params never overridden; DigitalOcean/Vast.ai/LLM Gateway/Z.ai stored as inactive verbatim slots (param fabrication would misattribute) |
| Rejected programs | Together (no free trial), OpenRouter/Neon/Fly.io/Supabase/fal/HF (no referral programs), Novita/SiliconFlow/ElevenLabs (code-entry or PartnerStack-enrolled, not URL-appendable) | no simple, verifiable, append-ready surface |

Unit-tested 11/11 edge cases (signup/root/www rewrite; existing-ref, off-path, foreign-host, relative, mailto, javascript: untouched). Bug caught in QA: `/` prefix initially matched every path → fixed to exact-root-only.

## 2. ADOPTED — qwen3.8-flash (Vyce · Alibaba Cloud)

- Verified REAL via 4 independent sources (r28-3b): Vyce `/v1/models` (`owned_by:"alibaba"`, `context_window:1000000`, landing bundle: `requiredTier:"free"`, `inputPrice:.1/outputPrice:.4`, "new" highlight), HF `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` (761K dl), OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.8-flash` ($0.15/$0.47), OrcaRouter.
- Relay: vyce T1 elo 0.965, note "Alibaba Qwen 3.8 · 1M ctx · $0.10/$0.40" (FAST_RE catches "flash" → decision/research fits). Provider roster + guide text updated. Vyce's "48438ms" from the user's screenshot is their live latency probe, not a spec — recorded here to avoid future confusion.

## 3. ADOPTED — Free/New Model Tracker (ticker + radar tab)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Sources | Tier A keyless: OpenRouter (444, real `created` + pricing), OrcaRouter (178), Pollinations (1); Tier A signal-only: HF recent text-gen (60, never alerts); Tier B keyed-when-vault-has-it: Vyce `/v1/models` via per-request BYOK transport | research probes: vyce keyless 401s (keyOptional:false correct); Groq/GitHub-catalog keyless fail; these four are the only live-200 sources |
| Novelty | OUR diff (firstSeenAt + "new" event), never upstream `created` | vyce `created` is a static placeholder (1719792000 on every row); upstream clocks unreliable |
| Cadence | server POST with 4h TTL guard + 10-min force throttle; client polls GET on mount/15min/focus; localStorage mirror for instant paint | "every 4-8 hour checker" without a cron process; still catches the 1-2 day firsthand window |
| False-alert defense | baseline-first sync (no events on first sight of a source), `sightings ≥ 2` for removals, HF demoted to signals, `isNew` earned ONLY by post-baseline arrivals and expiring after 48h | prevents 446-row event spam on day one and badge regression (QA caught 160-badge bug when update pass re-granted isNew) |
| Storage | Prisma SQLite: TrackedModel (key = `providerId::modelId` = relay hopKey) + TrackerEvent (cap 300) + TrackerMeta | enables one-click "Pin in this chat" straight from the ticker → per-chat model override |
| UX | always-on 8px marquee strip under the top bar (pauses on hover, reduced-motion respected) + popover panel (NEW/FREE badges, ctx, price, first-seen age, copy, pin) + Radar "Models" tab (filters All/New/Free, source-health chips, HF signals) + toasts for unseen events only | ticker = glanceable firsthand advantage; radar tab = full table; toasts never re-fire for seen events |

Rejected alternatives: scraping vyceai.com's landing bundle for its model list (hash-brittles per deploy — documented as manual fallback only); pure client-side polling (CORS + wasted mobile battery); trusting upstream `created` timestamps.

## 4. Verification evidence (r28)

- Live end-to-end event path: deleted a real row via Prisma → reset throttle → force sync → `{"eventsCreated":1,"newModels":1}` with genuine "new" event for `inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-vl:free`; ticker badge corrected to 1 after the isNew-grant fix.
- agent-browser: ticker strip + panel render w/ NEW/FREE badges + source metadata; Pin → "This chat now runs on inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-vl:free" toast + picker shows honest "pinned" fallback row; chat round-trip with Clock tool "Succeeded" + ROUTE receipt chip; assistant-rendered vyceai.com link decorated (href `?ref=VYCE_8ZYQDC`, rel `sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer`, REF chip); Radar Models tab (All·160/New·1/Free·30 + source health 444/178/1/60); Settings Referral card w/ ACTIVE vyce + verbatim-placeholder list; relay roster shows "Vyce AI · qwen3.8-flash".
- `bunx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors in src/; `bun run lint`: clean; console: no errors (HMR/info only); desktop scrollWidth == innerWidth; ticker panel width clamped for 390px viewports.

## 4. ADOPTED — r29 Autonomous Pipeline Doctrine (workflow engine)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Synthesis reserve | last in-budget tool round is followed by an explicit "TOOL BUDGET SPENT — write your final answer now" user message; no-tools final passes become purposeful | LangGraph/Temporal "reserve a final pass" doctrine; production failure: model ended on tool calls, step shipped a raw dump |
| Materials digest | ok-only body (last 8, 400-char clips, arg provenance `[query/url]`), failures collapsed into a one-line footer; fires on leaked tool-call markup AND degenerate empty finals (`""` seen in prod after 36 tool calls) | failures are structured, not content; downstream steps must never eat silence or error strings |
| Fetch policy (read_url) | ONE polite retry on 403/429/503 with browser UA + 2s backoff (only while ≥10s time headroom); 404/410 terminal | r29 research: 2-attempt max, UA upgrade beats bot-walls; dead links stay dead; total stays under the 30s executor timeout |
| Search hygiene | URL dedupe + per-host cap (3) in web_search rendering; every pipeline context opens with a `buildDateAnchor()` ("today is …") | domain caps + date anchoring were the two cheapest fixes for the "Red Sox in an AI briefing" drift |
| Scheduled autonomy | consecutive-failure streak on the schedule: success resets; fail 1-2 → re-arm in 10m/30m (quick backoff retries); fail 3 → breaker auto-pauses schedule + warning toast; half-open probe = user re-enables | Temporal/circuit-breaker doctrine (alert ≥2, trip at 3); ends the "6 failed runs waiting for you" pile-up |
| Degraded transparency | step-level `degraded` flag (sentinel test) → "auto-digest" chip in run panel + kanban count chip + `[ended on auto-digest]` marker in downstream context headers | honest receipts: users and downstream agents must know material is thin |
| Template v2 | Morning Briefing upgraded in place for existing users (v1 fingerprint = any step without instruction; schedules/user edits untouched); Research Brief/Build & Verify get step instructions; new Deep Research Dossier (map → gap-audit → gap-fill → writer, depth deep) | pipelines were running on generic seed-agent prompts only; sophisticated structure = pick/dedupe/verdict steps with hard output contracts |
| Store fix | workflows `add()` now carries `depth`/`schedule` (previously silently dropped — seeded workflows always lost depth) | pre-existing normalization bug found during QA |
| Auto-planner | plan contract gains per-step `instruction` (one focused sentence, editor validates + persists) | auto-planned pipelines could never produce step-specific guidance |

| r31 | Adopt the phase-5 roadmap ranks ①-③ (suite/traces/lessons) as one round | Panel sequencing note: ranks 1-3 are S-effort and unblock 4-8; every later change becomes an experiment instead of vibes | Suite runs real pipelines (quota cost); repeats default 1 with n≤3; results store aggregates only (localStorage discipline) |
| r31 | `openrouter/free` adopted as relay backstop ONLY after live verification | r28 truth-pass doctrine: catalog entries must be probed first (id + pricing + ctx confirmed: $0/$0, 200k ctx, text+image→text) | Non-deterministic random free-lane routing → elo 0.8, never a precision lane; documented in hop note |
| r31 | Conversations compaction strips old attachment payloads + hard message cap; quota errors surfaced | r31-1 landmine: unbounded growth + silent quota swallow under the ~5MB ceiling = data loss risk | Text stubs keep the attachment name/size; cap 120 messages; toast once/session via praison:storage-quota event |
| r31 | Schedule quarantine instead of boot-time throw | OpenClaw 9.1 gateway doctrine: malformed config must never block boot | Malformed = interval <1s, non-finite nextRunAt, or non-string task → disabled + console flag |
